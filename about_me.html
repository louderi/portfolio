    <h2><i>Brief Introduction</i></h2>
    <p>I'm a young female born in <b>Greenfield</b>, Indiana who has <i>always liked computers</i>. 
    Being on one since I was two years old, I was<br>
    able to <b>grasp the basics of it at a very young
    age</b>, and even memorising the keyboard by the time 
    I was six. My goals in life are to <br>become either a 
    <i>successful developer or animator</i>-- or perhaps <mark>both</mark>. 
    I've always enjoyed video games and have been trying 
    to <i>code my own</i> since<br> I was around fourteen. I've been 
    drawing since I was five or younger, and animating since
   I was nine. Everything until now is <b>self-taught</b>,<br> and I am 
   <i>seeking professionals to help me improve my skills so 
   they are better for the workfield.</i></p></center><hr>
